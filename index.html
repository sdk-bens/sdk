										<h2><a href="#">New API system for GPU SWE infrastructure</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/fastapi.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge API system for the GPU SWE, starting from scratch. Utilizing the latest technologies, I created a robust and efficient system that significantly improved performance and reliability. The APIs were meticulously designed with a focus on clean code, ensuring readability and maintainability. By eliminating code duplications, I enhanced the overall efficiency of the system. Furthermore, I implemented an automated documentation process, streamlining the documentation generation and making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the APIs effectively. The new API system stands as a testament to the dedication and innovation put forth, resulting in a fast, reliable, and highly optimized solution for the GPU SWE.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">New UI For GPU SWE </br> Faster than ever</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/uiu.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Working within the GPU SWE infrastructure team, we dealt with extensive data processing and management. The processed results were displayed on a website for our clients, other teams within the GPU SWE department. However, the website pages suffered from slow loading times due to the large amount of data being queried from various databases, including calculations, processes, and results. As part of my projects, I focused on resolving this issue, aiming to improve the speed of data access. The outcome was remarkable, with engineers now able to retrieve the data in less than 100 milliseconds, a significant improvement from the previous waiting time of over one minute.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">New API for GPU performance results</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/APIs.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Over 280 Engineers use the GPU SWE infrastructure system on a daily bases. They query data from a massive SQL Database (over 50 tables), with more than 6 billions row.</br>
								Engineers at different teams have different needs for data but the only option available is to use the general api which query all the data.</br>
								Teams then have to write scripts to only extract the needed data that meets their needs, therefore spending a lot of time just to deal with the massive data payload. 
								</br> With the new API, enginners now can query the exact data they need, saving days of not needed extra work.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Disclosure Reinforcemet</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Computer-Security.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Implemented enhanced disclosure guidelines within the GPU SWE infrastructure, ensuring improved data access control. Previously, teams had the ability to query all data, even for projects that were not disclosed. However, with the new system, engineers and teams are granted access only to the data that is directly related to the disclosed projects. This measure strengthens data privacy and security, providing a more focused and restricted approach to data retrieval and usage.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Backend Code Optimization</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Contributed to code optimization efforts by automating processes and employing helper methods. This resulted in the replacement of hundreds of lines of code with just a fraction, amounting to tens of lines. By streamlining and simplifying the codebase, the efficiency and maintainability of the system were significantly improved.  </p>
